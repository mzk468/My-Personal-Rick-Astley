## Inspiration
It'll be Rick Astley's 57th Birthday on Monday the 6th February, so we decided to make him live on forever in python!

We used `pyttsx3` as our TTS engine to allow Rick to speak to us, as well as using MP3s from the hit song "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick himself, allowing Rick to speak to us in his true spirit!

## What it does
Well, personal assistants (PAs) truly make people's lives better, and we decided to create a _hassle-free_, _trustworthy_ and _trendy_ product that represents everything a personal assistant is supposed to represent and more! No more of that "I am an AI so I don't have feeling" stuff and more "Never Gonna Let You Down" we say!

All in all, it does what a PA usually does, but it also has a personality! Ask him anything about him and he will respond! He'll also attempt to answer any questions you may have, with a fun "Rick Roll" twist every time he speaks.

## How we built it
We've used Python and a s***-ton of if statements. Now would be a good time to mention none of know how to use AI, however we are resourceful and will make use of what little we do understand about what we are given. So we used `if` statements.

Most notably we made use of TTS and Speech Recognition to allow for _human-like_ communication with our creation, and we made use of web-scraping where needed, especially for when questions are asked, among other APIs.

We also used Pygame as our GUI, if you'd like to call it that, and that allowed for simple animation, and we used multithreading to allow for control of 


## Challenges we ran into
None of us know how to use AI. And due to the time constraints, learning how to train an AI model, and especially learning everything about Rick Astley within 26 hours, it seemed unrealistic to use AI. So naturally, we opted for `if` statements, as they are the epitome of modern technologies and the absolute pride for propositional logic.

We also had a couple issues integrating our APIs, but that simply took trial and error to figure out what stuck and what didn't

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The sheer fact this project was possible by mostly avoiding AI is a feat, and we are truly proud of ourselves because of that. 

## What we learned
We learnt how to use Pygame, as well as multi-threading in Python. We also had a lot of practice writing `if` statements to the point where it's safe to say we'd describe ourselves as `if` statement professionals. (No don't ask us for references noone wanted to vouch for us).


## What's next for My Personal Rick Astley Assistant
Maybe we _actually_ learn how to make use of AI for such an undertaking, and maybe even deploy it as the next best thing? The sky's the limit for Rick Astley!
